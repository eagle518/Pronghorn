Welcome to the Pronghorn documentation.

To get started, please visit the [Quick Start guide](../quick-start-guide).

## Demo 
Below is recorded live footage of the telemetry of a Pronghorn project that encodes and decodes JPGs as demonstrated
[here](/Pronghorn/docs/jpg-raster).

## What is Pronghorn?
Pronghorn is a pragmatic approach to an actor based framework.
It is a staged event driven single machine embedded micro-framework written in Java, designed to be garbage-free, have a small memory footprint.

## Examples
For a project built completely with Pronghorn, there is GreenLighting, an incredibly fast & lightweight microservices framework.

For a real-world example of Pronghorn, please see [JPG-Raster](https://objectcomputing.github.io/Pronghorn/docs/jpg-raster/), a fast JPG encoder/decoder.

## What are the benefits of Pronghorn over similar frameworks/languages?
While Pronghorn is new to the industry, here are some frameworks and languages that have influenced Pronghorn and have similar goals:
* Akka
  * Unlike Akka, Pronghorn is completely garbage free.
* Play! Framework
* Erlang

## What is the expected usage?
Most projects using this framework will follow these steps:

1. **Define** your data flow graph.
2. **Define** the contracts between each stage.
3. **Test** first development by using generative testing as the graph is implemented.
