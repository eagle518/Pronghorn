## How to use it
Download the source code on the GitHub page ([here](https://github.com/oci-pronghorn/WebCookbook/)).
Extract the source and place it somewhere with write and read access on your system.

Run the following command in the directory with your source:
```
mvn install
```

This will install all the required dependencies.
You can then run the cookbook.

Use the "files" or "-f" arguments to specify a folder where your web files are located.
By default, it uses the `www` folder in your `HOME` environment folder.
